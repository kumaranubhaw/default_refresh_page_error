# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


* NOTE:

  Setup:
  1. Create database refresh_page.
  2. Change host in database to connect to your database.
  3. uncomment User.create_record in users_controller.rb to insert record in the table to demonstrate.

  Reproducing step:
  
  1. Run the server and trigger the url
  2. On the page display click on the button "Get User Details"
  3. Then the user details will be displayed in table.
  4. On this page if refreshing the page params do not contain data in the request to the controller.
  
  
 SOLUTION:
 
   By default the Rails form_tag helper creates a form with method="post". To make this a GET, change your view template to look something like:
   
   
   <%= form_tag({ :action => 'get_detail' }, :method => :get) do %>
   
    â€¦
   <% end %>
